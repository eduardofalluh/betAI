# --- OpenAI (real LLM) — use ONE of the two options below ---

# Option A: Encrypted storage (recommended). The API key is stored in api_key.enc and
# decrypted at runtime with BETAI_PASSPHRASE. Run once: python migrate_key_to_encrypted.py
# after putting OPENAI_API_KEY in .env, then .env will be rewritten with BETAI_PASSPHRASE only.
BETAI_PASSPHRASE=

# Option B: Plain env var (less secure). Only use if you prefer not to use encryption.
# OPENAI_API_KEY=

# Optional: model to use (default: gpt-4o-mini). Examples: gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-3.5-turbo
# OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
